### About

That's an application focused on React and Redux, here we can simple administrate our pending chores.

### Want contribute?

To contribute, you must prepare your environment first following a few easy steps:

First of all, clone this repository and let's go!

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) globally
- Install [NodeJS and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

#### MongoDB

After installing it, you'll need to run with that command

```
$ mongod
```

The server will be listening to connections, so we can proceed.

#### Back-End

Install modules and dependencies by:

```
$ npm install
```

With MongoDB running, to start the Backend is simple, just type on your command prompt:

```
$ npm run dev
```

#### Front-End

Install modules and dependencies by:

```
$ npm install
```

Run the application

```
$ npm run dev
```

#### TIPS

If the port in webpack.config.js is unvailable, try to change it to run Front-End application.

Enjoy it!
